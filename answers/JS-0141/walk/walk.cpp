This is the least useful part of this beautiful program,
although it's just a program to get some extra points...

Let's start. First, what is C++? C++ is a program language 
invented by * in * . Although a lot of languages had been 
invented in the past 50 years, C++ is still the most widely 
used programming language now. This is the best proof to 
prove that C++ is good enough. Its history is interesting, 
for sure, but its grammar is not easy at all. C++ has many 
different standards,such as C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20 ...
Each of these standards are different, and many right
programmes would go wrong on other computers. Can you imagine
that? You need to design a unique program for each type of
computer!

That is just a small part of its hardness. I don't want to 
talk about reheritation or class or multiple thread here, 
let's talk about the easiest thing: input and output. In 
other languages such as Python, there's just one way to
input a number: input() . But in C++ we have:
  cin>>  scanf()  getline()  getch()  getcha()  getchar()  
  fread()  fin>>  gets()  read()  ...
What about output? In Java you just need to write
  System.output.println()
But C++ is still complicated:
  cout<<  printf()  puts()  fout<<  fwrite()  putchar()  ...

ALthough it's complicated, I still like it very much, because
I can design something that follows my own opinion, and I can
find something very interesting by programming, that is
no matter how smart or stupid you are, as long as you made
something special, people would like it and you would get more
and learn more. They are not encouraging you but really loving
the things you've made. That's why I think writing programmes is the
easiest way to make innovation and creation.Maybe it's painful
to write, think, or debug, but I think it's worthy. I like C++.
Do you want to learn it?
